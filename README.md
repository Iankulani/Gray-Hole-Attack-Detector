# Gray-Hole-Attack-Detector
Cyber security tool used for detecting gray hole attack particulary in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) and Wireless Sensor Networks. In this attack, a malicious node selectively drops packets in the network while pretending to be a legitimate node, thus causing network disruptions without being immediately detected.
